      <Header>How to Contribute on the "Starter" Project</Header>
      <Text>When I first started programming, what I wanted more than anything was to collaborate on a team with other developers and gain real-world experience, build in-demand and highly sought after skills, and have a safe space to ask questions freely and learn with others.</Text>
      <Text>The problem is, to gain these things typically requires being employed by a company doing these things, and those companies don't hire you unless you know how to do those things.</Text>
      <Text>Starter is a place for <b>everyone</b></Text>
      <Text>To create code and develop professionally and personally with others of all skill levels and walks of life</Text>
