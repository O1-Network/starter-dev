      <h1>How to Contribute on this Project</h1>
      <p>When I first started programming, what I wanted more than anything was to collaborate on a team with other developers and gain real-world experience that allowed me to land my dream job, build in-demand and highly sought after skills, and have a safe space to ask questions freely and learn with others.</p>
      <p>The problem is, to gain these things requires being employed by a company doing these things, and those companies don't hire you unless you know how to do those things.</p>
      <p>Starter is a place for anyone to meet and create code with others at their level.  We want you to learn with others who are just as new as you.</p>
