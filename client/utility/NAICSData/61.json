  "desc": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Educational Services sector comprises establishments that provide instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects.  This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and training centers.  These establishments may be privately owned and operated for profit or not for profit, or they may be publicly owned and operated.  They may also offer food and/or accommodation services to their students.\n\nEducational services are usually delivered by teachers or instructors that explain, tell, demonstrate, supervise, and direct learning.  Instruction is imparted in diverse settings, such as educational institutions, the workplace, or the home, and through diverse means, such as correspondence, television, the Internet, or other electronic and distance-learning methods.  The training provided by these establishments may include the use of simulators and simulation methods.  It can be adapted to the particular needs of the students, for example sign language can replace verbal language for teaching students with hearing impairments.  All industries in the sector share this commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of instructors with the requisite subject matter expertise and teaching ability.\n",

The instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and training centers.\n\nThe subsector is structured according to level and type of educational services.  Elementary and secondary schools, junior colleges, and colleges, universities, and professional schools correspond to a recognized series of formal levels of education designated by diplomas, associate degrees (including equivalent certificates), and degrees.  The remaining industry groups are based more on the type of instruction or training offered, and the levels are not always as formally defined.  The establishments are often highly specialized, many offering instruction in a very limited subject matter, for example ski lessons or one specific computer software application.  Within the subsector, the level and types of training that are required of the instructors and teachers vary depending on the industry.\n\nEstablishments that manage schools and other educational establishments on a contractual basis are classified in this subsector if they both manage the operation and provide the operating staff.  Such establishments are classified in the Educational Services subsector based on the type of facility managed and operated.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in publishing educational software or other educational materials without providing instruction.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries.  Establishments that manage schools and other educational establishments on a contract or fee basis without providing the operating staff are classified in Subsector 561, Administrative and Support Services.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing vocational rehabilitation services and establishments primarily engaged in providing child care services are classified in Subsector 624, Social Assistance.\n",
