  "desc": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products.  The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.\n\nEstablishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and material handling equipment.  However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector.  Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them.  Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.  Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for other establishments on a contract or fee basis.  Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries, establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry of the processed materials.\n\nThe materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments.  The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, under the same ownership.\n\nThe new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing.  For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire product manufacturing establishment.\n\nThe subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material inputs, production equipment, and employee skills.  In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they are made for separate sale.  For example, an attachment for a piece of metalworking machinery would be classified with metalworking machinery.  However, component inputs from other manufacturing establishments are classified based on the production function of the component manufacturer.  For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.\n\nManufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing sector of NAICS.  For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management.  These captive services are treated the same as captive manufacturing activities.  When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified in the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing. \n\nThe boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry.  The establishments in the Manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products.  Their output is a new product.  However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.  As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NAICS:\n<table width=100%><tr><td width=10%> </td><td><dl><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Milk bottling and pasteurizing;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Water bottling and processing;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Fresh fish packaging (oyster<br/> shucking, fish filleting);</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Apparel jobbing (assigning<br/> materials to contract<br/> factories or shops for<br/>  fabrication or other contract<br/> operations) as well as<br/> contracting on materials<br/> owned by others;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Printing and related activities;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Ready-mix concrete production;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Leather converting;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Grinding lenses to<br/> prescription;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Wood preserving;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Lapidary work for the trade;</dt></dl></td><td width=10%> </td><td><dl><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Electroplating, plating, metal<br/> heat treating, and<br/> polishing for the trade;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Fabricating signs and<br/> advertising displays;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Rebuilding or remanufacturing<br/> machinery (i.e., automotive<br/> parts);</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Making manufactured homes<br/> (i.e., mobile homes) or<br/> prefabricated buildings,<br/> whether or not assembling/<br/> erecting at the customers'<br/> site;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Ship repair and renovation;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Machine shops; and</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Tire retreading.</dt></dl></td><td width=10%> </td></tr></table>\nConversely, there are activities that are sometimes considered manufacturing, but which for NAICS are classified in another sector (i.e., not classified as manufacturing). They include:\n\n1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting operation;\n2. Beneficiating ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, is considered part of the activity of mining;\n3. Constructing structures, assembling prefabricated buildings, and fabricating at the construction site by contractors are classified in Sector 23, Construction;\n4. Breaking bulk and reselling in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; assembling and selling computers on a custom basis; sorting and reselling scrap; mixing and selling paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order for resale are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade; and\n5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, transform information into a product for which the value to the consumer lies in the information content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software compact disc).\n",

      "title": "Primary Metal ManufacturingT",
      "desc": "Industries in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector smelt and/or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals from ore, pig, or scrap, using electrometallurgical and other process metallurgical techniques.  Establishments in this subsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals.  The output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make sheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.\n\nPrimary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  Establishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting, primary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output.  Establishments primarily engaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or dross.  The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot or billet that will be further processed.  Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are primarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes.\n\nExcluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing ferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings.  Although forging, stamping, and casting are all methods used to make metal shapes, forging and stamping do not use molten metals and are included in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily engaged in operating coke ovens are classified in Industry 32419, Other Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing.\n",

Establishments in this subsector may use one of these processes or a combination of these processes.\n\nThe NAICS structure for this subsector distinguishes the forging and stamping processes in a single industry.  The remaining industries in the subsector group establishments based on similar combinations of processes used to make products.\n\nThe manufacturing performed in the Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing subsector begins with manufactured metal shapes.  The establishments in this subsector further fabricate the purchased metal shapes into a product.  For instance, the Spring and Wire Product Manufacturing industry starts with wire and fabricates such items.\n\nWithin the Manufacturing sector there are other establishments that make the same products made by this subsector; only these establishments begin production further back in the production process.  These establishments have a more integrated operation.  For instance, one establishment may manufacture steel, draw it into wire, and make wire products in the same establishment.  Such operations are classified in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector.\n",

      "desc": "Industries in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector create end products that apply mechanical force, for example, the application of gears and levers, to perform work.  Some important processes for the manufacture of machinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  Processes, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together.  Although these processes are similar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically employs multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine.  Moreover, complex assembly operations are an inherent part of the production process.\n\nIn general, design considerations are very important in machinery production.  Establishments specialize in making machinery designed for particular applications.  Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for the purpose of implementing NAICS.  The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups that make machinery for different applications.  A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used in a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in a particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery).  Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The other industry groups make general purpose machinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing; Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.\n",

An entire subsector is devoted to this activity because of the significance of its economic size in all three North American countries.\n\nEstablishments in this subsector utilize production processes similar to those of other machinery manufacturing establishments—bending, forming, welding, machining, and assembling metal or plastic parts into components and finished products.  However, the assembly of components and subassemblies and their further assembly into finished vehicles tends to be a more common production process in this subsector than in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector.\n\nNAICS has industry groups for the manufacture of equipment for each mode of transport—road, rail, air, and water.  Parts for motor vehicles warrant a separate industry group because of their importance and because they require less assembly than complete vehicles.\n\nLand use motor vehicle equipment not designed for highway operation (e.g., agricultural equipment, construction equipment, and material handling equipment) is classified in the appropriate NAICS subsector based on the type and use of the equipment.\n",

      "title": "Furniture and Related Product ManufacturingT",
      "desc": "Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding and molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of manufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be purchased from industrial designers.\n\nFurniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, furniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a fabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.\n\nWhen classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant component material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered seats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are classified according to the frame material.\n\nFurniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., knockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.\n\nSome of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.\n\nNAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are notable exceptions: concrete, ceramic, or stone furniture; seating for transportation equipment; and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These are classified in Subsector 327, Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing; Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing; and Subsector 339, Miscellaneous Manufacturing, respectively.\n",
