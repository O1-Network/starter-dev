These essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy.  The establishments in this sector specialize in one or more of these support activities and provide these services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  Activities performed include: office administration, hiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security and surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services.\n\nThe administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.  Establishments in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises, normally undertake the strategic and organizational planning and decision-making role of the company or enterprise.  Government establishments engaged in administering, overseeing, and managing governmental programs are classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.\n",

The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general management, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities of establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have specialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide.\n\nMany of the activities in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that businesses and organizations perform in-house.  However, it is common to contract or purchase services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services more efficiently.\n\nThe industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly \"support.\"  The Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, such as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, including individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the \"support\" nature (e.g., travel arrangement) to businesses and other organizations that purchase such services.\n\nThe administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.  These activities may also be performed by establishments that are part of the company or enterprise.  However, establishments involved in administering, overseeing, and managing other establishments of the company or enterprise are classified in Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises.
