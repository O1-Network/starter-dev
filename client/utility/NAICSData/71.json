{"title":"Arts, Entertainment, and RecreationT","desc":"The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector includes a wide range of establishments that operate facilities or provide services to meet varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests of their patrons.  This sector comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure-time interests.\n\nSome establishments that provide cultural, entertainment, or recreational facilities and services are classified in other sectors.  Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational facilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels, are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and beverages are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries and archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in Sector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation.\n","childNodes":{"711":{"title":"Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related IndustriesT","desc":"Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative, and technical skills necessary to the production of these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.\n\nThe industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.\n\nThis subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include performing arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.\n","childNodes":{"7111":{"title":"Performing Arts CompaniesT","desc":"This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged in producing live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, and other performing artists.\n","childNodes":{"71111":{"title":"Theater Companies and Dinner TheatersT","desc":"See industry description for 711110.","childNodes":{"711110":{"title":"Theater Companies and Dinner Theaters","desc":"This industry comprises (1) companies, groups, or theaters primarily engaged in producing the following live theatrical presentations: musicals; operas; plays; and comedy, improvisational, mime, and puppet shows and (2) establishments, commonly known as dinner theaters, engaged in producing live theatrical productions and in providing food and beverages for consumption on the premises.

For example, operators of resorts and hunting and fishing camps provide both accommodation and recreational facilities and services.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation, partly to reflect the significant costs associated with the provision of accommodation services and partly to ensure consistency with international standards.
