{"title":"Other Services (except Public Administration)T","desc":"The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Other Services (except Public Administration) sector comprises establishments engaged in providing services not specifically provided for elsewhere in the classification system.  Establishments in this sector are primarily engaged in activities such as equipment and machinery repairing, promoting or administering religious activities, grantmaking, advocacy, and providing drycleaning and laundry services, personal care services, death care services, pet care (except veterinary) services, photofinishing services, temporary parking services, and dating services.\n\nPrivate households that engage in employing workers on or about the premises in activities primarily concerned with the operation of the household are included in this sector.\n\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in retailing new equipment and also performing repairs and general maintenance on equipment.  These establishments are classified in Sector 44-45, Retail Trade.\n","childNodes":{"811":{"title":"Repair and MaintenanceT","desc":"Industries in the Repair and Maintenance subsector restore machinery, equipment, and other products to working order.  These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs.\n\nThe NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and categorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and the necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  This NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve households.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of customer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and consumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap.\n\nThe Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For example, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and other goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of transportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and these activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists with repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other construction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction as well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to distinguish between the two types and all are included in the Construction sector.\n\nExcluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in rebuilding or remanufacturing machinery and equipment.  These are classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.  Also excluded are retail establishments that provide after-sale services and repair.
