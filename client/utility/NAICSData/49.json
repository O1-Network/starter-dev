  "desc": "The Sector as a Whole\n\nThe Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, warehousing and storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation.  Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation-related facilities as a productive asset.  The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation.  The modes of transportation are air, rail, water, road, and pipeline.\n\nThe Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode of transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support activities for transportation.  In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.\n\nA separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for transportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects.  Secondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries.\n\nOne of the support activities identified in the Support Activities for Transportation subsector is the routine repair and maintenance of transportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal, or ships at a harbor or port facility).  Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of transportation equipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or transportation equipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems).  An establishment that primarily performs factory (or shipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or ships is classified in Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing, according to the type of equipment.\n\nMany of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area.\n\nWarehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse establishments do not sell the goods.\n\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent, travel arrangement, and reservation services that support transportation establishments, hotels, other businesses, and government agencies.  These establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing medical care with transportation are classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance.\n",

      "desc": "The Postal Service subsector includes the activities of the National Post Office and its subcontractors operating under a universal service obligation to provide mail services, and using the infrastructure required to fulfill that obligation.  These services include delivering letters and small parcels.  These articles can be described as those that can be handled by one person without using special equipment.  This allows the collection, pick-up, and delivery operations to be done with limited labor costs and minimal equipment.  Sorting and transportation activities, where necessary, are generally mechanized.  The restriction to small parcels distinguishes these establishments from those in the transportation industries.  These establishments may also provide express delivery services using the infrastructure established for provision of basic mail services.\n\nThe traditional activity of the National Postal Service is described in this subsector.  Subcontractors include rural post offices on contract to the Postal Service.\n\nBulk transportation of mail on contract to the Postal Service is not included here, because it is usually done by transportation establishments that carry other customers' cargo as well.  Establishments that provide courier and express delivery services without operating under a universal service obligation are classified in Subsector 492, Couriers and Messengers.\n",

These articles may originate in the U.S. but be delivered to another country and can be described as those that may be handled by one person without using special equipment.

The restriction to small parcels partly distinguishes these establishments from those in the transportation industries.  The complete network of courier services establishments also distinguishes these transportation services from local messenger and delivery establishments in this subsector.  This includes the establishments that perform intercity transportation as well as establishments that, under contract to them, perform local pick-up and delivery.  Messengers, which usually deliver within a metropolitan or single urban area, may use bicycle, foot, car, small truck, or van.\n",
